    "Like all major cities in the United States, Seattle undergoes a lot of crime activity. In fact, crime rate per capita has been increasing the past few decades, and the city now holds one of the <a href=\"http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/city-attorney-candidate-property-crimes-higher-in-seattle-than-any-other-us-city/627266113\">highest property crime rates in the country</a>. By identifying the highest occurring crimes in all the regions of Seattle, it could make it easier to prevent them in the future by focusing on the factors behind those frequent crimes in those areas.</p>\n",
    "<p>The Seattle Police Department released a data set of over 1 million 911-calls from 2009 onwards from all the different regions in the city. The goal of this project is to use this data set and create an algorithm to identify the most probable crimes that will occur based on a region in the city."
